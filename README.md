# BRAIN GAMES (Training Project)
### This project features five math games. In every game the principle is the same: the player must give the correct answer in three rounds in a row to win. If the player gives an incorrect answer in any of the three rounds, a defeat is assigned and the game ends. Next on the list are attached videos of the implementation of these mathematical games:
